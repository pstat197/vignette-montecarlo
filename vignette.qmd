## Monte Carlo Simulation: What is it?

Monte Carlo simulation is a computational technique that uses **repeated random sampling** to approximate unknown quantities. Instead of relying on closed-form analytical solutions, which may not exist or may be extremely complicated, Monte Carlo methods approximate expectations, integrals, probabilities, and distributions by simulating a large number of random draws and summarizing the results. The core idea is simple: *if you cannot compute something exactly, simulate it many times and approximate it.*

## Why Use Simulations: {.smaller}

Monte Carlo methods are widely used because:

-   Many statistical quantities (expectations, variances, probabilities) have no simple closed-form expressions.

-   Modern models (e.g., high-dimensional, nonlinear, or stochastic systems) are analytically intractable.

-   Simulation-based estimates converge to true values as the number of samples increases (by the Law of Large Numbers).

-   Monte Carlo methods provide natural tools for quantifying **uncertainty**, constructing confidence intervals, and evaluating sampling variability.

-   They are flexible and can be applied to almost any distribution or model, even when the underlying mathematics is complex.

In data science and applied statistics, Monte Carlo simulation provides a practical and powerful way to approximate results that traditional methods cannot handle easily.

## **Work Flow: Random Input → Sampling → Evaluate → Average**

A typical Monte Carlo simulation follows a simple flow:

1.  **Random Input:** Draw samples from a known distribution (e.g., normal, uniform).

2.  **Sampling:** Generate many independent random draws.

3.  **Evaluate Function:** Apply a function or rule to each sample (e.g., indicator for an event, transformation).

4.  **Average Output:** Compute the average of all values, which approximates the true expectation or probability of interest.
